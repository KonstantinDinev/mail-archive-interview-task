I have spent about 3-4 hours to reach the current result. I decided to use material-ui and style it according to
the design specification. Styling the input field for the date range picker took me some time. 

To generate dynamic data I used a public API provided by 'faker' npm module. Then I created data model. 

I didn't do the last design screen for Mobile resolutions as I don't have the required time to spend on this.
